## Setup
Start LocalStack on your machine

    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install awscli-local

Run `localstack.sh` to create SQS queue and DynamoDB table.

Install [LocalStack Docker extension](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/tools/localstack-docker-extension/) to
later see the DynamoDB records
